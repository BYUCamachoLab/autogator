# Configuring AutoGator

You use a text file!


If used as a single-machine host and client, PyroLab may simply be configured
to expose everything on localhost, including a nameserver, meaning no ports
will be exposed to any outside network. This may be useful in circumstances
where security is a concern or a single computer is powerful enough to host all
necessary resources. AutoGator can also then be configured to lookup and
connect to devices on the localhost network.
