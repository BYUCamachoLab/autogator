Experiment
==========

Experiments are at the core of what AutoGator is built to do. 

An Experiment is a class that encapsulates all the information needed to test 
a single circuit within a GDS file. AutoGator provides a base experiment that
shows the required functions and attributes for an experiment, but it is up
to the user to implement their actual experiment. AutoGator does provide a
couple default experiments that can be used as examples as you tailor build
custom experiments. If the basic experiments provide enough functionality
for you, all the better.

In addition to Experiments, there is the concept of a Batched Experiment. This
object allows you to group a number of Circuits together and run the same
experiment on all of them. This is useful for testing a large number of
circuits in a single run. Since AutoGator has stage calibration functionality,
the researcher theoretically can begin a BatchExperiment and let the data
collection happen autonomously, without supervision, as the software will
optimize over each Circuit before performing the data collection routine.
