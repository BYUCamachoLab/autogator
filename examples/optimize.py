# Optimizer

Optimization example. Allows you to first navigate the stage to the vicinity
of a circuit to test, and then does a coarse scan to try to locate some
signal. Once a signal has been found, switches to a fine "line scan" that
goes to the general location the signal was found in, switches to a fine step,
and maximizes the x and y return. If optimization is unsuccessful, allows you
to relocate the chip and try again.

In this example, your stage configuration must include a data acquisition
object configuration as an auxiliary device for the stage. We use a
Rohde & Schwarz oscilloscope as our data acquisition unit. See the function
docstrings below for more details.
