# Calibration

Calibrates the stage so that circuits can be accessed by GDS coordinate
instead of motor coordinates.

Ordinarily, you would save the calibration matrix to a file, or associate
it with a setup. This example simply prints the calibration matrix to the
screen.

    Moves to the specified circuit and optimizes alignment.

    ``calibrate()`` requires a callback function that takes the stage,
    DAQ, circuit, and controller as arguments.

    We use this callback to move to the next location and optimize the
    alignment. We have roughly found where the light is at each location,
    so this function automatically moves to the next location and 
    optimizes the alignment. If it fails, it then allows you to manually
    move the stage before it attempts to optimize again.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stage : Stage
        The stage to move.
    daq : DataAcquisitionUnitBase
        The DAQ to use for data acquisition.
    circuit : Circuit
        The circuit being moved to for calibration.
